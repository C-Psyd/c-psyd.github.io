# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have external funding for additional PhD positions. We can only welcome you if you are already admitted into Cornell via linguistics or CS or if you have a fellowship. You have the best chance of joining as a graduate student by applying to Cornell linguistics.  

[Apply to Cornell linguistics here](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/graduate#admissions:).  

If you are interested in joining as a postdoc or an affiliated research assistant professor, I'm happy to support funding applications. Send me an email describing your interests, and we can work out some funding proposals. Here are some funding options:  

[Klarman postdoctoral fellowship](https://as.cornell.edu/research/klarman-fellowships)  

[Cornell Presidential Postdoctoral Fellowship](https://research.cornell.edu/content/fellowship-essentials)  

[Assistant Research Professorship, Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/professorship-program/)  


We are always looking for motivated new group members!  

You will help discover how the human mind processes language, how it makes predictions using incomplete information, and how language operates at scale. You will work at the frontier of psycholinguistics and natural language processing to push both fields forward. You will develop skills with programming, human experimentation, data analysis, and statistics.  

### Applications for Cornell PhD admission
If you are interested in applying to Cornell to work with us, **please don't email me to ask if you should apply**. Just [apply to Cornell linguistics](https://linguistics.cornell.edu/graduate#admissions:) and state your desire to work in C.Psyd in that application. I get several emails each day asking if people should apply and I am unable to respond to them all. If you are interested in what we do, and you have a background in linguistics, cognitive science, or computer science, you should apply!

### Cornell students looking to join C.Psyd
If you are already a student at Cornell University, feel free to send me an email to describe your background and express your interest. Most likely, I will invite you to sit in on the C.Psyd lab meetings to help you develop project ideas. You should also consider taking Computational Linguistics I (LING 4424/6424), [Computational Linguistics II (LING 4434/6434)](https://vansky.github.io/2020-cl2.html), or the computational linguistics seminars that are regularly offered through linguistics ([for example](https://vansky.github.io/2021-compsem.html)). You may also be interested in the [other NLP courses at Cornell](https://nlp.cornell.edu/courses/).
